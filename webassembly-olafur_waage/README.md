# Sandbox Games: Using WebAssembly and C++ to make a simple game

# Ólafur Waage 

WebAssembly is an interesting environment, especially for C++ programmers. With tools like Emscripten becoming better and better and game development libraries starting to add support for WebAssembly it is worth taking a look into this world.

We will go over what WebAssembly is, how a development environment might look like and then make a simple game that will run in the browser using C++. While making the game we will hit a few hurdles that are unique to WebAssembly and see how they can be overcome.

After this talk, you should have a good overview of WebAssembly and it can be used. This talk targets intermediate to advanced C++ programmers and no experience of game development is required.
