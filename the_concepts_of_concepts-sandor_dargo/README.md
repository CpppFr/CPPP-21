# The concepts of concepts

# Sandor Dargo

In this talk, you'll learn all you need to know about one of the flagship features of C++20; concepts. First, I'll explain the concept behind concepts, why templates needed this extension. Then we'll discover the different ways concepts can be used with functions and with classes. What kind of concepts do we get with the standard library of C++20? That's also something we'll discuss, right before we will start the most interesting part of this session; how to write your own concepts? From the simplest we'll go towards more complex examples while describing all the different constraints we express with concepts. We'll finish with some real-life examples where concepts can document better and/or simplify our codebase.
