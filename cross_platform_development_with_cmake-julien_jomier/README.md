<p>CMake is an open source, cross-platform, build system generator which supports portable C++ development. CMake has been downloaded over 9M times and is becoming the standard for building C++ applications. In this talk we'll present the main features of CMake and how it can help you write a better and more maintainable build system. We will also tackle how CMake can help with package management as well as testing infrastructure.</p><p>If you are already familiar with CMake, this talk will present new features we are implementing in CMake and how it can be useful for your every day development.</p>
