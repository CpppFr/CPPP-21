# Just Enough Assembly for Compiler Explorer

# Anders Schau Knatten

<p>Every other conference talk these days seems to be showing off some code on Compiler Explorer. But what does all that Assembly actually mean?</p><p>In this talk you'll learn the very basics of x86-64 Assembly and the System V AMD64 calling convention, just enough to understand the full Assembly listing of simple functions on Compiler Explorer. No previous experience with Assembly is necessary, but a basic understanding of C or C++ is useful. </p><p>After this talk you will:</p><ul><li>Be able to paste code from your own project into Compiler Explorer, and either understand the Assembly output or know how to simplify it until you do.</li><li>Have a solid understanding of the fundamentals, so you know what to search for and understand it when you need to know more.</li></ul><p>(Compiler Explorer is an increasingly popular tool which allows you to see exactly what the compiler does with your code.
