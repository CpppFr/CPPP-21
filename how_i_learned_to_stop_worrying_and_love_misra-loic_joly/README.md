# How I learned to stop worrying and love MISRA

# Loïc Joly

MISRA C++2008 is a collection of coding rules aimed at safety-critical software. It is used in many places, and is prominent in the automotive sector.

As a developer of a static analysis software, I have created tools that can automatically validate if some code is MISRA-compliant. And I hated it. Those rules seemed to go against everything that I knew and loved about C++. A few years ago, I learned that MISRA was working on an updated version of its standard, and instead of remaining on the side, grumpily criticizing the new release, I decided to join this group.

In this talk, I will tell of my journey, and how part of what I hated in MISRA was indeed due to some misunderstanding about what MISRA really is and really means.
